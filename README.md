you are in a pre-historic temple and accidently step on a foundation stone and temple start shaking.you have the map of the temple but you need shorted way out to survive lets see if this code can save you

we are using Q-learning algorithm which is is a reinforcement learning technique used in machine learning. The goal of Q-Learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It does not require a model of the environment and can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.

the structure of the temple  is uploaded seperatly
